# random number generation:

# multiline strings :

# /multilineString = """hi,

# Strings are Arrays :
# /stringArray = "apple"
# print(stringArray[4]) # will print word of position 4/

# Looping Through a String :
# /loopString = 'testerbird'
# for x in loopString:
#     print(x)/


# Check String :
# /test = '''hi
# there i am tuly speaking, how may i help you?'''
#
# print('y' in test)/


# Use it in an if statement:

# /test = 'hello you, who are you?'
#
# if 'who' in test:
#     print('present')/

# Check not in String :
# /test = '''hi
# there i am tuly speaking, how may i help you?'''
#
# print('x' not in test)/

# Use it in an if statement:

# /test = 'hello you, who are you?'

# Slicing Strings :
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 :

# sliceable_string = 'i am from bangladesh'
# print(sliceable_string[2:6]) #here last length == 6-1 == 5 which means last postion - 1 will be returned WHERE INDEx starting at psotion 0


# Slice From the Start :

# sliceable_string = 'test bird is nothing but a tester word'
#
# print(sliceable_string[:4]) # print up to position 3 as 4-1 == 3


# Slice To the End :
# /sliceable_string = 'bangladesh my bangladesh '
# print(sliceable_string[9:]) # will start from position 9/


# Negative Indexing :
# sliceable_string = 'bangladesh my bangladesh'
# print(sliceable_string[-3: ])
